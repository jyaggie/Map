During the morning hours of July 21, a cold front extended from northcentral Wisconsin southwestward through northwestern Iowa.  Ahead of the cold front, over the upper midwest, a very humid, unstable airmass had set up.  By late morning, a small cluster of thunderstorms had developed over northwestern Illinois.  These storms tracked into northcental Illinois, reaching their peak intensity over Ogle County, producing wind gusts up to 58 mph and causing isolated incidents of damage to trees.  This storm cluster then weakend as it moved eastward.

By early afternoon, more thunderstorms began to develop over northeastern Illinois.  A small area of strong thunderstorms initially developed over Kane and western Will Counties and rapidly developed into a line of severe storms extending over the Chicago metro area.  The line of storms rapidly moved through Du Page, Cook and Will Counties and into northwestern Indiana.  These storms left a path of wind damage over southern portions of the Chicago metro area and into rural sections of northwestern Indiana.  Strong wind gusts were also measured by coastal observing stations of Lake Michigan.

The path of the damage was from northwest to southeast, but many of the trees were blown from southwest to northeast, across the damage path. This indicated there was likely rotation.

Rainfall rates were as much as two to three inches per hour in some areas.EVENT NARRATIVE: Very heavy rain fell across much of north central Cook County producing widespread flooding and flash flooding during the early morning hours of July 24th.  Hundreds of streets and thousands of basements were flooded.  Numerous homes were surrounded by flood waters with water damage on the first floor.  Several hundred vehicles were submerged or floating in flood waters, many were a total loss.  Areas that suffered some of the most widespread flooding and extensive damage included Westchester, Western Springs, La Grange, Oak Park, Bellwood, Riverside, Berwyn, Brookfield, Hillside and Forest Park.  In Westchester, 40 residents were evacuted by boat when their homes were completed surrounded by flood waters.  In Hillside, 56 residents of a convalescent home were evacuated onto a bus because of flood waters.  The bus then became stranded in flood waters and was pushed out by a front-end loader.  Twelve feet of water (which was overflow from the Chicago River) flooded the basement of a 17-story building in River City in Chicago.  No structural damage was reported but 80 to 90 cars in the basement were a total loss.  Portions of both Interstate 94 and Interstate 290 were closed due to flooding, including Interstate 290 just east of Des Plaines Avenue in Forest Park.  The Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago estimated that over 60 billion gallons of water fell on Chicago and parts of Cook County, which quickly filled all 190 miles of the Deep Tunnel system.  Once this tunnel filled, floodgates were opened in Wilmette and on the Chicago River, releasing untreated stormwater into Lake Michigan.  Storm total rainfall amounts inclueded 7.89 inches one mile southwest of Oak Park; 6.43 inches at O'Hare Airport; 6.16 inches one mile northeast of Countryside; 5.84 inches about a half mile southwest of La Grange Park; 5.82 inches one mile west of Stickney; 5.58 inches near Streamwood; 5.47 inches two miles northwest of Melrose Park and 5.1",820467,253380000

In Prospect Heights, a sewage lift station lost power for about 6 hours, causing the flooding to be worse in some areas.  Some basements were completely flooded with flood water and sewage 8 to 10 feet deep.  In Mt. Prospect, an estimated 100 vehicles were disabled in high water.

Some of this water seeped into the lower level lobby.  In Park Ridge, nearly 500 basements were flooded along with numerous streets.  In nearby unincorporated Maine Township, more than 500 residences and 175 businesses were affected by flooding.  Hundreds of vehicles suffered some amount of flood damage with some vehicles completely covered by flood waters.

In Niles, more than 240 homes suffered some level of flooding with 5 to 6 feet of water in some basements.  In Glenview, three manhole covers were blown off by the flood waters with numerous flooded streets.  In Glencoe, numerous streets were flooded and impassible stranding dozens of cars.

Chicago O'Hare Airport measured 6.78 inches of rain during a 3 hour period between 1251 am CDT and 351 am CDT, with 3.19 inches falling between 151 am CDT and 251 am CDT.  This extreme rainfall which fell across much of central Cook County caused widespread street, parking lot and basement flooding with numerous cars stranded and submerged.
